                Hello, my name is Robin and I am a student passionate about computer science.<br><br>

                I began my engineering studies in France in the city of Chambéry, where I studied for two years.<br>
                I continued my studies in Tours before leaving to complete the final year of my three-year program in Longueuil, Quebec. <br><br>

                After four years of general training with modules in development, networking, and project management, 
                the fifth year is dedicated to my specialization in the field of cybersecurity.<br><br>

                Alongside my studies, I practiced competitive swimming for ten years, training up to 18 hours per week.
                This allowed me to develop strict discipline and a desire to go further, which I use in my work. <br><br>

                I worked as a lifeguard after obtaining the BNSSA (National Water Safety and Rescue Certificate) 
                and the PSE1 (Level 1 Team First Aid).<br>
                Those are French certifications in first aid and aquatic safety.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am available to discuss my career path and any professional opportunities.<br>
                Please feel free to contact me via the <a href="contact.html">Contact</a> page.
